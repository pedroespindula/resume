Furthermore, I aim to learn about perfomance optimization in the Backend and Software Architectural design to build reliable systems. Additionally, I have interest on ways to create frontend interfaces, UX and testing for providing the end user the best possible experience; and also in NLP, text parsing and web scraping for data analysis.",
