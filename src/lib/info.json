Currently, all of my efforts are on understading frontend interfaces, UX and testing for providing the end user the best possible experience. Furthermore, I'm interested in NLP, specifically in text parsing and web scraping to allow data analysis on top of speeches and reports. Additionally, I have interest on ways to provide robust infrastructures for systems with Docker, Kubernetes and AWS.",
